# Challenge Summary
- Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge Description
- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- O(n) - no matter what, this function will need to go through all values on each tree once.
