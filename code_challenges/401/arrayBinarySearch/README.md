## Binary Aray Search

### Challenge
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

### Approach & Efficiency
I approached the problem by using a for loop, so it will work for any type of array, looping through the array until it locates the search key.
