## Array Shift

### Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency
I approached the problem by first setting variables that took in the array, identified the length and divided by 2 to get a middle index number, so it will work for any array length.
