# Challenge Summary
Use a breadth first search to find the maximum value in a binary tree

## Challenge Description
Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Efficiency
O(n) - no matter the case or location of the highest value, the function will still need to traverse the entire tree.
