# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/SianCulligan/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/38)

### Challenge
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

### Approach & Efficiency
I approached the problem by first thinking through the basic problem (zipping 2 lists) & building the function to handle edge cases by checking the length of the given linked list.

## Question:
- I couldn't figure out how to feed 2 linked lists through as arguments, so for the tests, I gave the function 2 arrays that the function could make into a linked list. I'd love to know the right way to do this - can someone please help point me to a resource or help me out?
