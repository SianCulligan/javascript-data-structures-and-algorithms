# Linked List Implementation
Linked-list.js file holds the list constructor & extended class
Linked-list.test.js holds the tests

## Challenge
- Create a linked list that has nodes that are linked together by reference (val, next, prev), starting at the head.
- Extend the LinkedList class to include 3 new prototypes: append, insertBefore, & insertAfter
- Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.
    
## Approach & Efficiency

- Insert(): o(1)
This function is able to add in nodes without transversing the entire list.
- Includes(): o(n)
- toString():o(n)
Both the includes and toString have to transvers the list, making the big O = O(n).
    
## Testing
Use `npm test linked-list.test.js` to run tests
