# Implementation: Graphs
graph.js file holds the list constructor
grapg.test.js holds the tests

## Challenge
- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
- AddNode()
- AddEdge()
- GetNodes()
- GetNeighbors()
- Size()
    
## Approach & Efficiency
- AddNode() - o(1)
- AddEdge()- o(1)
- GetNodes()- o(n)
- GetNeighbors()- o(n)
- Size()- o(n)
    
## Testing
<!-- Description of how to run your tests -->
Use `npm test graph.test.js` to run tests
