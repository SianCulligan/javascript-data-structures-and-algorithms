## Challenge
 Create three classes, Node, BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree. The binary tree needs to preform 3 depth first searches - preOrder, inOrder, & postOrder. The binary search tree needs to have 2 fuctions, one to add a value and one checking if a value exists
    
    
## Approach & Efficiency
    
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I tried to approach this problem by starting with exporting the stack & queue classes, then using those existing functions to make building these classes a little easier. Turns out that was totally wrong - getting a strng understanding of what the first, preOrder function was doing was essential to getting the rest of the functions written.
